# BuddyStudy

## Assembly && Running Backend

%root% - root dir with project

If you're using windows, run .sh files in git bash, it's simple.

## Method 1: Building with Intellij IDEA

## Method 2: Building with binaries

In dir `%root%/buildConfig/`:

`buildBackend` - build release in dir `%root%/backend/build/install/`

`runBackend` - build && run release from dir `%root%/backend/build/install/` .

To run release without build: run `%root%/backend/build/install/BuddyStudyBackend/bin/BuddyStudyBackend`

`runBackendSources` - run debug without building release
